61. Why is HTTPS mandatory for APIs?
    ✅ Answer

HTTPS encrypts data in transit, preventing:

- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

- Token theft

- Data tampering

### 📊 Diagram

```
HTTP:
Client ── plaintext ──> Server ❌

HTTPS:
Client ── encrypted ──> Server ✅
```

### 🔐 Interview Line

Any API without HTTPS is already compromised.

# 62. TLS vs SSL

✅ Answer

SSL is **deprecated**; TLS is the secure successor.

| SSL        | TLS                 |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Old        | Modern              |
| Insecure   | Secure              |
| Deprecated | Actively maintained |

### 📊 Diagram

```
SSL ❌ → TLS 1.2 / 1.3 ✅
```

### 🔐 Best Practice

Only allow TLS 1.2+ (prefer TLS 1.3).

# 63. What is certificate pinning?

✅ Answer

Pinning ensures the client trusts **only a specific certificate or public key.**

### 📊 Diagram

```
Client → Check Cert Fingerprint → Accept / Reject
```

### 🔐 Use Case

- Mobile apps

- Prevents rogue CAs

# 64. What is HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)?

✅ Answer

Forces browsers to always use HTTPS.

### 📊 Header

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
```

### 📊 Diagram

```
Browser → HTTPS only → Server
```

### 🔐 Benefit

Stops SSL-stripping attacks.

# 65. How do you secure sensitive data in transit?

✅ Answer

- HTTPS (TLS)

- Strong ciphers

- Disable weak protocols

### 📊 Diagram

```
Sensitive Data → TLS Tunnel → Server
```

### 🔐 Interview Tip

Encryption in transit ≠ encryption at rest.

# 66. How do you encrypt data at rest?

✅ Answer

Encrypt data stored in DB, disk, backups.

### 📊 Diagram

```
Data → Encrypt → Store
Retrieve → Decrypt → Use
```

### 🔐 Examples

- AES-256

- Disk encryption

- DB column encryption

# 67. Hashing vs Encryption

✅ Answer
| Hashing | Encryption |
| --------- | -------------- |
| One-way | Two-way |
| Passwords | Sensitive data |
| No key | Requires key |

### 📊 Diagram

```
Password → Hash → Store
Data → Encrypt → Store → Decrypt
```

### 🔐 Golden Rule

Never encrypt passwords — hash them.

# 68. Why is bcrypt preferred over SHA?

✅ Answer

SHA is **fast** → bad for passwords.
bcrypt is slow + **salted** → secure.

### 📊 Diagram

Password → bcrypt(salt) → Hash

### 🔐 Interview Line

Fast hashes are attackers’ friends.

# 69. What is salting?

✅ Answer

Salt = random data added to password before hashing.

### 📊 Diagram

Password + Salt → Hash

### 🔐 Benefit

- Prevents rainbow tables

- Same password ≠ same hash

- 70. What is key management?
      ✅ Answer

Key management handles `creation`, `storage`, `rotation`, `revocation` of crypto keys.

### 📊 Diagram

```
App → KMS → Encrypt / Decrypt
```

### 🔐 Best Practices

- Never hardcode keys

- Rotate regularly

- Use KMS (AWS KMS, Vault)

### 🎯 Interview-Ready Summary (61–70)

- HTTPS is non-negotiable

- TLS > SSL

- Hash ≠ Encrypt

- bcrypt > SHA

- Keys must be managed, not hidden
