# 51. What is a REST API?

### Explanation

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web APIs using HTTP methods.

### Core Principles

- Stateless

- Client–server separation

- Resource-based URLs

- Uses HTTP verbs

### Example

```
GET    /users
POST   /users
PUT    /users/1
DELETE /users/1
```

### Interview Tip

REST is not a protocol, it’s a design style.

# 52. Difference between PUT and PATCH

### Explanation

| PUT               | PATCH           |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| Full update       | Partial update  |
| Replaces resource | Modifies fields |
| Idempotent        | Idempotent      |

### Example

```
PUT /users/1
{
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@mail.com"
}
```

```
PATCH /users/1
{
  "email": "new@mail.com"
}
```

# 53. What is Rate Limiting?

### Explanation

Rate limiting restricts how many requests a client can make within a time window.

Prevents:

- DDoS

- Brute-force attacks

- API abuse

### Example (Express)

```
import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100
});

app.use(limiter);
```

# 54. What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?

### Explanation

JWT is a stateless authentication mechanism where user data is stored inside a signed token.

### JWT Structure

```
header.payload.signature
```

- Header → Algorithm

- Payload → Claims

- Signature → Integrity

# 55. How Does JWT Authentication Work?

### Flow

- User logs in

- Server creates JWT

- Client stores token

- Token sent in headers

- Server verifies token

### Example

```
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, {
  expiresIn: "1h"
});
```

### Middleware:

```
jwt.verify(token, secret);
```

### Interview Tip

JWT is not encrypted, only signed.

# 56. What is OAuth?

### Explanation

OAuth is an authorization framework allowing third-party access without sharing passwords.

Used by:

- Google login

- GitHub login

### OAuth Flow (Simplified)

```
Client → OAuth Provider → Token → Access Resource
```

### Interview Tip

OAuth ≠ Authentication (it’s authorization).

# 57. Cookies vs LocalStorage

| Cookies                   | LocalStorage           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Sent with HTTP request    | Not sent automatically |
| Limited size              | Larger storage         |
| More secure with HttpOnly | Vulnerable to XSS      |

### Interview Tip

Use HttpOnly cookies for JWT.

# 58. What is Session-Based Authentication?

### Explanation

User session is stored on the server, and session ID is stored in cookies.

### Flow

- Login

- Session created

- Session ID sent to client

- Client sends cookie on each request

### Example

```
app.use(session({
  secret: "secret",
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true
}));
```

# 59. What is Helmet in Express?

### Explanation

Helmet sets **secure HTTP** headers to protect against attacks.

Prevents:

- XSS

- Clickjacking

- MIME sniffing

### Example

```
import helmet from "helmet";
app.use(helmet());
```

# 60. What is Morgan?

### Explanation

Morgan is an HTTP request logger for Express.

Used for:

- Debugging

- Monitoring

### Example

```
import morgan from "morgan";
app.use(morgan("dev"));
```
