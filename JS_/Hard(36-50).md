# 36. Explain execution context

Environment where JS code is evaluated (Variable Object, Scope Chain, this).

# 37. What is lexical environment?

Structure holding identifiers and their values.

# 38. What is garbage collection?

Automatic memory management using mark and sweep.

# 39. Explain microtask vs macrotask

# 40. What is currying?

Transform function with multiple args into nested functions.

# 41. What is function composition?

Combining multiple functions into one.

# 42. What is immutability?

Data cannot be modified after creation.

# 43. What is Object.freeze()?

Prevents object modification.

# 44. What is `call`, `apply`, `bind`?

**call** → args separately

**apply** → args as array

**bind** → returns new function

# 45. What is module pattern?

Encapsulation using closures.

# 46. What is tree shaking?

Removing unused code during bundling.

# 47. What is shadow DOM?

Encapsulated DOM for web components.

# 48. What is memory leak?

Unused memory not released due to references.

# 49. What is WeakMap?

Map with weakly referenced keys.

# 50. Explain JS single-threaded nature
