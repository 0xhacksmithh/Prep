# 16. What is `closure`?

A function that remembers variables from its outer scope.

# 17. What is scope?

Determines variable accessibility (global, function, block).

# 18. What is event loop?

Handles async operations using `Call Stack`, `Callback Queue`, `Microtask Queue`.

# 19. What is promise?

An object representing future completion or failure.

```
Promise.resolve("done");
```

# 20. Promise states?

`pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`

# 21. What is async/await?

Syntax sugar over promises for cleaner async code.

# 22. Difference between synchronous & asynchronous?

**Async** → non-blocking

# 23. What is this?

Refers to object calling the function (depends on context).

# 24. What is `prototype`?

# 26. What is event bubbling?

Event propagates from `child → parent`.

# 27. What is event capturing?

# 28. What is deep vs shallow copy?

**Shallow** → references shared

**Deep** → new memory allocation

# 29. What is spread operator?

# 32. What is `IIFE`?

Immediately Invoked Function Expression.

# 33. What is `debounce`?

Delays function execution until user stops triggering.

# 34. What is `throttle`?

Limits function execution to fixed intervals.

# 35. What is `memoization`?
